# Sudoku Puzzles Solver using Python (Analysis 3 Different Approaches!)

## Introduction
Welcome to my humble Python Notebook! In this notebook, we will explore the fascinating world of Sudoku.

## What is Sudoku?
- Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle that has captivated puzzle enthusiasts worldwide. It involves a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 sub-grids, and the objective is to fill in the grid with digits from 1 to 9 in such a way that each column, each row, and each sub-grid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetition.
- Sudoku puzzles generally start with some of the cells already filled in, and the solver's task is to complete the remaining cells following the game's rules. 
- The puzzles vary in difficulty, some relatively straightforward and others requiring advanced problem-solving techniques.

In this notebook, we will compare and analyze multiple Sudoku solver implementations using Python. We will explore different approaches and algorithms to tackle Sudoku puzzles of varying complexity. 
The main goal of this notebook is to compare different approaches and techniques in solving Sudoku. So let's dive in and embark on our Sudoku-solving adventure!

We're going to compare three different approaches, all of which guarantee 100% accuracy in solving Sudoku puzzles:
1. Backtracking Algorithm
2. Naked Twin Approach (My implementation 1)
3. Naked Twin Approach (Online implementation 2)
